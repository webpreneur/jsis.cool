            While I wanted to implement an Angular HTTP Loader interceptor.
        </p>
        <p>
            My first problem was that it had to handle multiple, concurrent HTTP requests.
            Therefore I had to introduce a counter which increases when an HTTP request was sent
            and decreases when an HTTP request is finalized.
        </p>
        <p>
            But this lead to another issue, which was that the tap runs twice and finalize only once.
            So I needed to add a condition to check if the type of the HTTPEvent is 0 or not.
            Now I only increase the request counter 
            when the type of the HTTPEvent is 0, which means that the request was sent successfully.
        </p>
