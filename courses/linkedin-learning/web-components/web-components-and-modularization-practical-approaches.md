[Morten Rand-Hendriksen - Web Components and Modularization: Practical Approaches](https://www.linkedin.com/learning/web-components-and-modularization-practical-approaches/)

---

Components are the building blocks of the modern web.
This course is about component thinking.

Advantages of Components:
- Better DX (Developer Experience)
- Reusability
- Testability
- Better Architecture
- Encapsulation
- Component Thinking
  - organized
- Simplification
  - underlying complexity is hidden by components
- 

# Components as Mental Model

- heuristics...

## Atomic Design

- Atoms (e.g.: HTML tags)
- Molecule
- Organisms
- Templates
- Pages

## Blocks and Pieces (eg. LEGO)
Another approach a component's mental model

## Design Steps

1. Visual Mockup


# Component Principles
- **One-task** ~ (Ideally) do "one" thing only
- **Top-down** ~ One way flow only from top to down)
- **Isolation** ~ Independent from the state of other components
- **Stand-alone** ~ Operation and testable in isolation
  - testability
  - reusability
