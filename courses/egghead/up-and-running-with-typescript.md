## Unlock TypeScript's Features in Vanilla JS with @ts-check and JSDoc

TypeScript can help you with your plain JavaScript files if you add a simple **//@ts-check** comment. Then you can enhance the experience by add proper **JSDocs** to describe your functions which will feed type information into TypeScript and give you a development experience near TypeScript itself.

You'll want to make sure that **javascript.validate.enable** is enabled in your VS Code settings in order to see type errors in your vanilla JS files.
